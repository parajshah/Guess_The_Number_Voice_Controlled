# Guess The Number Mini Game- Voice Controlled
This is my second python project that uses voice controlled input and output.
All of us have played "Guess the Number" game at some point in our childhood right?
It uses Google's speech recognition and pyttsx3 module for voice related input and output. 
This is a new version of the game that is fully voice controlled and requires a microphone to operate. 
Thank You :)
